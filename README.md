# Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer

A comprehensive C program to simulate and visualize memory management techniques including paging, segmentation, virtual memory, and page replacement algorithms.

## Features

### Memory Management Techniques
- **Paging System**: Virtual-to-physical address translation
- **Segmentation**: Segment-based memory allocation
- **Virtual Memory**: Demand paging with swap space simulation
- **Page Replacement Algorithms**: FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms

### Visualization Features
- Real-time memory state display
- Page table visualization
- Segment table display
- Statistics tracking (hit ratio, fault ratio, etc.)
- Animated page fault simulation

### User Interface
- Console-based menu system
- Interactive simulation controls
- Demo mode for quick testing
- Color-coded output for better readability
